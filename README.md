Improved AI for Planetary Annihilation

I love AI. To put my old person comfy jumper on for a moment, back in the day I modded Total Annihilation's AI and ran a site called AI Central (WARNING: very 90's site design) for AI mods, and I ran an AI league for Kohan II to identify the best. I've been an enthusiast in AI for as long as I've been gaming. This Queller AI will be a continuation of my Queller AI for TA.

This mod is a total overhaul of the AI (as much as can be done with the exposed files) designed to leverage the systems @sorian has created, while playing a game better suited to the meta. It will definitely be designed with 1v1 in mind, but will hopefully prove to be an improvement in other modes too.

I am currently focused on the AI's 1v1 game on single planets.

Things I want to do:
Opening builds aligned with real players
Unit mixes suited to current balance
More aggressive early play
Platoon and squad sizes better suited to the units contained within them
Faster expansion on empty planets
Much greater use of teleporters to move around
Scouting units which can also punish lone fabbers
Avoiding losing games through premature orbital
Overhaul of naval play
Targeting lone fabbers more aggressively
Using bombers more appropriately
Changing of strategies according to planet size
Changing of strategies according to player density
Some of these might prove impossible given the tooling available, only time will tell.
