Queller-AI
==========

Improved AI for [Planetary Annihilation](http://www.uberent.com/pa)

I love AI. To put my old person comfy jumper on for a moment, back in the day I modded Total Annihilation's AI and ran a site called [AI Central](http://aicentral.tauniverse.com) (WARNING: very 90's site design) for AI mods, and I ran an AI league for Kohan II to identify the best. I've been an enthusiast in AI for as long as I've been gaming. This Queller AI will be a continuation of my Queller AI for TA.

This mod is a total overhaul of the AI (as much as can be done with the exposed files) designed to leverage the systems sorian has created, while playing a game better suited to the meta. It will definitely be designed with 1v1 in mind, but will hopefully prove to be an improvement in other modes too.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. For issues please include a link to the game on [PA Stats](http://www.pastats.com/) or the replay ID. Failing that, please provide the system name, the number of AIs, their difficulty setting, and which slot(s) the players occupied.

##Â GOALS

Some of these might prove impossible given the tooling available, only time will tell.

- Opening builds aligned with real players
- Unit mixes suited to current balance
- More aggressive early play
- Platoon and squad sizes better suited to the units contained within them
- Faster expansion on empty planets
- Much greater use of teleporters to move around
- Scouting units which can also punish lone fabbers
- Avoiding losing games through premature orbital
- Overhaul of naval play
- Targeting lone fabbers more aggressively
- Using bombers more appropriately
- Changing of strategies according to planet size
- Changing of strategies according to player density

## MAP NOTES

#### Forge

The AI plays far worse in the northern spawn

#### Pacific

The AI will generally play better in the southern spawn

## THINGS I AM THINKING ABOUT

- Compare enemy mobile presence to static defence and adjust army ratio accordingly
- Get the Commander to build walls around itself when under threat
- Can the Commander be assigned to a platoon?
- How can I detect the AI is in a FFA and adjust decisions accordingly?
- Only tech on land when alone or unable to expand and ditch the whole idea of teching while winning? Perhaps don't tech when winning if no one else is teching?
- Better optimise the opening builds according to the map size and number of players
- Needs to be think about when to stop building at sea/land on mixed maps
- Is Kestrel play a thing?
- I really need to improve the use of Booms
