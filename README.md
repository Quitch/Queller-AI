# Queller AI

> _"Your Queller AI is literally best teacher there is when it comes to pure learning how to play this game, especially \[the\] basics" - B13, Uber rank #2_

Improved AI for [Planetary Annihilation: TITANS](https://planetaryannihilation.com/)

This mod is a total overhaul of the AI designed to smooth out the difficulty curve, providing more humanlike challenges that are both easier and harder than the vanilla AI. It features complete support for the [Legion Expansion](https://github.com/Legion-Expansion/Legion-Expansion).

You must install [Galactic War Overhaul](https://forums.planetaryannihilation.com/threads/client-galactic-war-overhaul.72360/) if you want Queller AI in your Galactic War.

Please ensure that if you use this work you credit Quitch's Queller AI.

## INSTALLATION

You should download and install this mod via the Planetary Annihilation TITANS in-game [Community Mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1417396826).

## DIFFICULTY

## RECOMMENDED DIFFICULTY

Below are recommendations for the difficulty you may wish to start on based on what you set the vanilla AI to or your ladder ranking.

When you need to increase the challenge, but don't want to increase the difficulty, give the AI an eco-boost rather than adding more AIs. Not only will this be better for the sim, but will also stop the problem of there being fewer resources to go around for the AI which in turn makes it easier to beat. Alternatively, put the AI into shared armies.

Comparison between vanilla difficulty and Queller difficulty:

| Vanilla    | Queller | Eco |
| ---------- | ------- | --- |
| Normal     | Casual  | 1.0 |
| Hard       | Silver  | 1.0 |
| Relentless | Gold    | 0.8 |
| Absurd     | Gold    | 1.0 |

Suggestions based on 1v1 ranked position or challenge sought:

| League   | Placement | Difficulty | Eco |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | --- |
| Bronze   | Low       | Bronze     | 1.0 |
| Bronze   | Mid       | Silver     | 1.0 |
| Bronze   | High      | Gold       | 1.0 |
| Silver   | Low       | Platinum   | 1.0 |
| Silver   | Mid       | Uber       | 1.0 |
| Silver   | High      | Uber       | 1.2 |
| Gold     | Any       | Uber       | 1.4 |
| Platinum | Any       | Uber       | 1.6 |
| Uber     | Any       | Uber       | 1.8 |

## SUBPERSONALITIES

By default, Queller at Uber level will adapt its play to try and suit the system and the opposition it faces. You can use subpersonalities to customise Queller's game to your liking or help it play better where it's making poor strategy choices.

### 1v1

- Optimised for 1v1 play

### Bot

- Doesn't build vehicle factories

### Free-For-All

- More cautious about engaging in battle
- Techs earlier
- Orbital earlier
- Avoids antagonistic scouting raids

### Rush

- Techs late
- Slower to enter orbital

### Tank

- Doesn't build bot factories

### Turtle

- More likely to build defences at its expansions
- More likely to build titans

## MAP NOTES

The spawn the AI starts in and the profile used can make a big difference, even for symmetrical 1v1s. If you find the AI too easy on a map, try a different spawn point for it. And don't use Bedlam, the AI's forces can't pathfind on this map.

Be sure to follow the recommended number of players for any map.

## KNOWN ISSUES

### CANTFIX

- Will sometimes take much longer than necessary routes to attack

- Won't use more than one teleporter at a time
- Won't use teleporters to move around a single planet
- Cannot reclaim
- Combat Fabbers can only be used to build mines or repair troops, not both, even across entirely different AI personalities

- Legion can't use orbital transports
- Doesn't use the Helios teleporter
- Naval factories sometimes stop producing units
- All AI Commanders on a team spawn and act together using shared army mode
- Play From Here in Chronocam can cause strange AI behaviour or even break it
- Different armies will sometimes build on the same metal spot
- Naval factories occasionally built on land
