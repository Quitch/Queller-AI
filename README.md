Improved AI for Planetary Annihilation

The AI will work with any difficulty/personality, but it has only being tested with Absurd.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. If possible, please provide a PA Stats link, and failing that the name of the system you were playing on. Please direct all feedback to the forum thread - https://forums.uberent.com/threads/rel-server-queller-ai-alpha-v0-2.65795/

I love AI. To put my old person comfy jumper on for a moment, back in the day I modded Total Annihilation's AI and ran a site called AI Central (WARNING: very 90's site design) for AI mods, and I ran an AI league for Kohan II to identify the best. I've been an enthusiast in AI for as long as I've been gaming. This Queller AI will be a continuation of my Queller AI for TA.

This mod is a total overhaul of the AI (as much as can be done with the exposed files) designed to leverage the systems @sorian has created, while playing a game better suited to the meta. It will definitely be designed with 1v1 in mind, but will hopefully prove to be an improvement in other modes too.

I am currently focused on the AI's 1v1 game on single planets.

THINGS I WANT TO ACHIEVE

Opening builds aligned with real players

Unit mixes suited to current balance

More aggressive early play

Platoon and squad sizes better suited to the units contained within them

Faster expansion on empty planets

Much greater use of teleporters to move around

Scouting units which can also punish lone fabbers

Avoiding losing games through premature orbital

Overhaul of naval play

Targeting lone fabbers more aggressively

Using bombers more appropriately

Changing of strategies according to planet size

Changing of strategies according to player density

Some of these might prove impossible given the tooling available, only time will tell.
