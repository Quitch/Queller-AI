Queller AI
==========

Improved AI for [Planetary Annihilation: Titans](http://www.uberent.com/pa)

This mod is a total overhaul of the AI designed to smooth out the difficulty curve, providing more humanlike challenges that are both easier and harder than the vanilla AI. It features complete support for the [Legion Expansion](https://github.com/Legion-Expansion/Legion-Expansion).

Please ensure that if you use this work you credit Quitch's Queller AI.

## RECOMMENDED DIFFICULTY

Below are recommendations for the difficulty you may wish to start on based on what you set the vanilla AI to or your ladder ranking.

When you need to increase the challenge, but don't want to increase the difficulty, give the AI an eco boost rather than adding more AIs. Not only will this be better for the sim, it'll stop the problem of there being less resources to go around for the AI which in turn makes it easier to beat.

## SUBPERSONALITIES

By default, Queller at Uber level will adapt its play to try and suit the system and the opposition it faces. You can use subpersonalities to customise Queller's game to your liking, or help it play better where it's making poor strategy choices.

### Air
 - Unrestricted air usage

### Bot
 - Doesn't build vehicle factories except to detect mines

### Free For All
 - More cautious about engaging in battle
 - Techs earlier

### Naval
 - Attempts to build a naval factory first
 - Unrestricted naval usage

### Orbital
 - Will get orbital as soon as possible on multi-planet systems

### Rush
 - Favours bots
 - Techs late

### Tank
 - Doesn't build bot factories

# MAP NOTES

The spawn the AI starts in and the profile used can make a big difference, even for symmetrical 1v1s. If you find the AI too easy on a map, try a different spawn point for it.

And don't use Bedlam, the AI's forces can't path find on this map.

Be sure to follow the recommended number of players for any map.
