- Overhauled naval platoons
- Fixed issue preventing AI attacking with naval forces
- Resolved all known issues of idle fabbers
- Will try to be aggressive about getting in the water when no land attack route exists
- Removed beta tag

#### v0.5.1 - 2015/01/08

- All fabbers can build naval again
- Removed three fabber opening

#### v0.5.0.1 - 2015/01/06

- Updated for new meta
- Wider variety of openings now possible, more responsive to what opponent is doing
- Added bot raid platoons per the updated default AI
- SXX lasers can now be accompanied by Avenger escorts
- Don't build basic fabbers if you can build advanced ones
- First pass at some proper naval play
- AI builds naval platoons at sizes relevant to the threat (will need tuning)
- Naval platoons broken down into squads
- Torpedo defences used in identical fashion to laser turrets
- Higher ratio of advanced fabbers to factories
- Bot sightings can now cause the AI to go air if it hasn't already
- Much greater spacing between radars
- At this point ignores almost all AI personality settings not relating to the economy
- Allowed to drop more defences at heavy MEX concentrations
- Tries to ensure it has advanced radar for advanced naval
- Added support for catalysts
- Updated now obsolete Need[Basic/Advanced]LandFabber to use the new Bot/Vehicle test
- Take the skies before building bombers

#### v0.4.2 - 2014/11/27

- After reverting platoons I forgot to revert the squad percentage makeup to my own. Now fixed.

#### v0.4.1 - 2014/11/11

- Reverted AI land platoon sizes to vanilla settings as it seems the AI is better with large numbers of small platoons than small numbers of large platoons

#### v0.4 - 2014/11/11

- Corrected bug where AI only used half as many Dox scouts as it was supposed to
- Updated basic factory builds to work properly in a multi-planet scenario
- Increased maximum land platoon sizes
- Removed fighter requirement from bomber platoons
- Small land platoons are now only formed for mobile targets
- Bomber platoons are now only formed for mobile targets (and teleporters)
- First pass on orbital
- Return to mandatory bot factories, but the number is based on the size of the planet
- Reverted to Firefly scouts because the AI seems severely limited when it has poor scouting
- AI shouldn't prematurely tech unless it has really bad intel
- A teleporter should always be the first thing the AI constructs on landing somewhere
- Assistance allowed on combat units again so a fabber has something to do when it has nothing to build
- Disabled storage for the time being as I just can't stop it building the things at stupid timings

#### v0.3 - 2014/11/09

- Skitter can be used to scout if AI plays a three vehicle opening (this is now actually true)
- AI will no longer go all bots
- Increased chances of MEX defence
- AI will now prefer dual lasers in place of single lasers
- Increased distance between radar installations
- Increased platoon minimum size requirements
- Further reduced use of infernos
- Slammers now used where naval has been sighted
- AI will continue to produce units regardless of whether a teleporter exists yet
- Removed advanced to basic factory ratio requirement
- Greater ratio of fighters to bombers
- Less bombers required for the AI to roll out an air attack
- Reverted to economy building rules more aligned with the default AI (this is now actually true)
- Fabbers will now construct basic factories in the "mid game"
- Higher number of advanced fabbers "required"
- AI no longer uses Catapults or Holkins
- More assistance allowed and required on various defence/offence structures

#### v0.2 - 2014/11/07

- Total overhaul of AI's opening builds
- AI now has bot, tank and air openings
- Openings are influenced by planet size
- Number of fabbers determined by opening factory choices
- Further refinements to the AI's building of defences
- Changes to air platoon sizes
- Allowed assistance on factory building to prevent opening fabber assisting troop building and then going into immediate radar
- Skitter can be used to scout if AI plays a three vehicle opening
- Reverted to economy building rules more aligned with the default AI (for now)
- AI will no longer build offensive Pelters

#### v0.1 - 2014/11/05

- Alpha release
- AI uses larger platoons
- AI produces more factories
- Unit mix completely overhauled
- Commander given responsibility for all basic factory production
- Scouting now done by Dox and Hummingbirds in place of Fireflies and Skitters
- AI builds far less turrets
- Much higher percentage of fighters to bombers in air squadrons
- Naval platoon updated to use squads - untested
- AI opens with troops immediately after its first fabber
- Drastically lowered the basic fabber to factory ratio
- Raised the fabber ratio for empty planets
- The AI will now only build the Orbital Launcher in emergencies or when it's winning on its planet
