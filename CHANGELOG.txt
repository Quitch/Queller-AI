Fixed bug in checking placement of advanced naval factory
Updated for new AI folder structure
No longer stops building GIL-Es when there is an orbital threat

v1.3.2

Put the ai_unit_map file back because I need it for the Piranha. Derp!

v1.3.1

Now works on air only maps
Removed dependency on ai_config (except for unit cap, but 3000 will do)
Now checks for Commander as a means to determine whether this is a military or eco planet
Fixed an error that allowed proxy air bases to spam air fabbers
Dropped custom ai_unit_map file until such time as I actually use it

v1.3

More aggressive about building MEX defences
Will build turrets to remove enemy MEX when there's no threat in the area
Deploys Spinners at lower threat levels
Deploys Spinners in reaction to losing the air war in anticipation of bombers to come
A little faster at getting in the water on island maps like Meso (and at getting out of it)
A little less energy floating
More aggressive about getting nukes where no enemy antinuke exists
Won't spam antinukes when there's no nuke threat unless planets exist where it has no presence
Will no longer build Piranhas it doesn't need
Will stop building ships after a while if it no longer has anywhere to send them
Reduced scout spam a little
No longer spams naval fabbers in lakes
Invests in Hummingbirds at lower threat levels due to a tendency to underestimate the threat and not have enough of them
Only builds land troops when alone on a planet if it has somewhere to send them

v1.2.4

When unable to expand it now checks its need for an advanced factory against the number of advanced factories not fabbers
Inferno, Spinner and Skitter ratios are now calculated only against units which are relevant to their potential platoon makeup
Added support for Pelters and Holkins
Will always get at least one orbital fabber out
Corrected error allowing the AI to build Bumblebees and air fabbers when it's losing the air war
Less air fabber spammy during the opening on naval maps
Maintains a higher Hummingbird minimum force

v1.2.2

No longer builds Skitters in reaction to scouting a Commander (herp derp!)
Will spam Umbrellas over planets it owns (this is going to need some work)
Will attempt to protect the commander from orbital snipes using Umbrellas (might be a bit spammy right now)

v1.2.1

Now builds Skitters when it has seen mines or advanced combat fabbers
Will now only build an orbital launcher to run away to another planet if there's another planet to run away to

v1.2

Removed platoon minimum requirements for frontline units to allow Queller to form land attacks faster
Will build Bluehawks and Stingrays when there's an orbital threat
Will try and go orbital when it has no local expansion options, even if it's not winning the battle on the planet
If a game has gone orbital then the AI can go bots late to allow it access to Bluehawks for invasion support
Corrected major whoopsie where AI wouldn't build advanced vehicle fabbers when it had a planet to itself
Now builds Vanguards in relation to the number of Shellers it has
Removed Slammers for the time being as AI needs dedicated anti-naval Slammer platoons to use them effectively
Forced some advanced fabbers regardless of eco to get AI out of the trap of never being able to afford them
Will keep building Hummingbirds even on empty planets so as to counter Phoenix attacks
Stingray now correctly used as a defensive unit in all naval platoon sizes

Much greater use of naval fabbers on naval maps
No longer starts air
Stopped the Commander spamming air factories
More aggressive about building Hummingbirds to own the skies
Builds orbital fabbers and Avengers from the orbital factory

Take the skies before building bombers

v0.4.2

After reverting platoons I forgot to revert the squad percentage makeup to my own. Now fixed.

v0.4.1

Reverted AI land platoon sizes to vanilla settings as it seems the AI is better with large numbers of small platoons than small numbers of large platoons

v0.4

Corrected bug where AI only used half as many Dox scouts as it was supposed to
Updated basic factory builds to work properly in a multi-planet scenario
Increased maximum land platoon sizes

Small land platoons are now only formed for mobile targets
Bomber platoons are now only formed for mobile targets (and teleporters)
First pass on orbital
Return to mandatory bot factories, but the number is based on the size of the planet
Reverted to Firefly scouts because the AI seems severely limited when it has poor scouting
AI shouldn't prematurely tech unless it has really bad intel
A teleporter should always be the first thing the AI constructs on landing somewhere
Assistance allowed on combat units again so a fabber has something to do when it has nothing to build

KNOWN ISSUES

TOFIX

Builds too many orbital factories on gas giants
Doesn't close out orbital games well even when it has an overwhelming economic advantage
Takes too long transition from a naval start to a land game on mixed maps
Often floats its eco on higher eco boosts
Doesn't take over empty planets fast enough
Playstyle not well suited to multi-planet FFAs with single planet starts

MAYBEFIX

Doesn't handle enemy walls well
Won't use more than one teleporter at a time
Stops sending orbital radars to enemy worlds in the late game
Will build a late bot factory on land maps when it shouldn't
Will use fabbers to construct factories when the commander is on planet

WONTFIX

AI personalities will have little impact on the unit composition

CANTFIX

First fabber always assists as its first action
Will sometimes take much longer than necessary routes to attack
Fabbers don't always take the closest metal spot when building MEX
Doesn't defend its fabbers
Attempts to attack with Dox underwater
Will queue buildings on the other side of obstacles despite closer locations (pathfinding wise) being available
Won't move orbital units (except fabbers and radar) between planets
Will send orbital radar to gas giants
Won't send Phoenixes between planets
Will assign fabbers to a assist on a project that they could start earlier than the fabber they're assisting
Will send air fabbers to follow much slower ground fabbers
Will only determine where to build with an orbital fabber after it has arrived in orbit leading to unnecessary delays in construction
Will sometimes send fabbers which arrive through a teleporter on unnecessarily long journeys to construct things
Will count orbital fabber as a fabber presence when looking to send fabbers through teleporters to planets without fabbers
Won't attack anything on a gas giant with Avengers
